# service-worker-test

a simple test to see how it differs from using workbox & writting it's own

## current browser setup for https

We need to let the browsers serve the app throught https. Thanks to this [simple guide we have ](https://improveandrepeat.com/2016/09/allowing-self-signed-certificates-on-localhost-with-chrome-and-firefox/)

### in chrome:

```
chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost
```

should be checked

### in firefox:

just add an exceptions for the website

## building & launching

`npm install` then:

### custom service worker

```
npm run serve:custom
```

will run on [https://localhost:3500](https://localhost:3500)

### using google workbox

```
npm run serve:workbox
```

will run on [https://localhost:3600](https://localhost:3600)

## issues

on `chrome` the custom script isn't reliable for an unfound reasonâ€¦

Getting this strange error:
```
Failed to fetch 
```
